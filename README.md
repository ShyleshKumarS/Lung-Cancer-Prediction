# Lung Cancer Prediction(On going)

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict lung cancer based on various features extracted from medical imaging data. The model will classify cases into three categories: normal, malignant, and benign.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of medical images of lung tissue, along with associated metadata such as patient demographics and clinical information. It is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityamahimkar/iqothnccd-lung-cancer-dataset



## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as normalization, feature extraction, and handling missing values.
2. Model Selection: Several machine learning algorithms are evaluated to identify the best-performing model for lung cancer prediction.
3. Model Training: The selected model is trained on the preprocessed data using appropriate training techniques.
4. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Results Analysis: The results are analyzed to gain insights into the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.



## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the prediction script: `python predict.py`

## Future Work
- Explore additional features for improving model performance.
- Enhance the model's interpretability for clinical use.
- Incorporate deep learning techniques for feature extraction and classification.
